                    <p class="aboutext">
                        Aaron Huy Tran began his photography journey without a fixed plan or vision. Initially, he simply wanted to document his friends and the moments they shared. However, as he immersed himself in the world of photography, a profound realization struck him: the power of capturing everyday actions as a form of art.            </p>
                    <p class="aboutext">
                        As a native of Portland, Oregon, Aaron's surroundings influenced his photographic style. Portland's unconventional and offbeat atmosphere seeped into his work, adding a unique and artistic touch to his photographs. Aaron found inspiration in the city's "weirdness" and sought to infuse that spirit into his images.            </p>
                    <p class="aboutext">
                        Through his explorations, Aaron discovered the immense potential of embracing the unorthodox. He realized that by pushing the boundaries and venturing outside the realm of traditional photography, he could find innovative solutions to unfamiliar problems. Aaron firmly believes that the unconventional path leads to new insights and personal growth.

                    <p class="aboutext">
                        While striving for technical perfection is a common pursuit in photography, Aaron adopted a different approach. He found beauty in imperfections—the smudges on the camera lens, the motion blur, and the unprofessional editing. These elements added authenticity and character to his work. Instead of aiming for flawlessness, Aaron's goal became capturing fleeting moments in time—moments that could never be replicated.
                    </p>
                    <p class="aboutext">
